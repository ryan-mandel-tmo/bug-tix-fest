# Your goals

You are supposed to fix this app. Explain your process as you work. The problems with the app should be limited to the following files: App.js, App.css, index.js, Reducer.ts, and package.json. If you are uncertain with any of the asks, be sure to ask me.


Goal 1 is to get it to compile and display without crashing.


Goal 2 is to get it to match these specifications:

The header is supposed to be blue, its content should be left justified, vertically centered, and fully visible. The react Icon should display as a slowly rotating button that does nothing when clicked. The text should say "Welcome Jenny" on load.

The main contents first line should be a functioning text edit with confirmation button that allows the user to change the name displayed in the header.

The main contents second line should be a counter that starts at 0 and increments when the the button is pressed.


Goal 3 is to talk generally about how you might redesign the code To be more readable/efficient/resilient. What would be the best practices you would like to follow? 


Goal 4 is to talk about a specific new feature (you do not need to code it). The counters value is now supposed to come from an API that you poll every 30 seconds. The increment button hits a different API and sets the value based on that APIs return value. How would you approach implementing this?
