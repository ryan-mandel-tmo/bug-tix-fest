# Your goals

You are supposed to fix this app. 

Goal 1 is to get it to compile and display without crashing.

Goal 2 is to get it to match these specifications:
The header is supposed to be blue, its content should be left justified, be centered, and fully visible. The react Icon should display as a slowly rotating button that does nothing when clicked.
The main contents first line should be a functioning text edit with confirmation button that allows the user to change the name displayed in the header. 
The main contents second line be a counter that starts at 0 and increments when the the button is pressed.

Goal 3 is to talk generally about how you might redesign the code To be more readable/efficient/resilient. What would be the best practices you would like to follow? 

Goal 4 is to talk about a specific new feature. The counters value is now supposed to come from an API that you poll every 30 seconds. The increment button hits a different API and sets the value based on that APIs return value. How would you approach implementing this?
